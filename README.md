# Word Clock ðŸ•—

## It tells the time... but in words!

### This project is kinda ironic condisering I'm dyslexic...

#### Plot

I was watching this YouTube video of a 40'000'000 USD LA mansion tour and there was this clock which told the time in words, the video had a link to the clock, and it was over 2 grand! I though I could make that easy, turn it into an android or IOS app, stick it on a tablet and stick a tablet to the wall!
Here is my WinForms mockup as a proof of concept, I even added a stopwatch for functionality!
